    <dialog concept="fragment-based screening" scenario="scenario-donothing.xml" description="the difference between the traditional lead discovery approach and fragment based approach" poke_message="How does the size of fragment space compare to drug space?">
    	
        <intro>
Why can fragment libraries be so much smaller than a traditional, drug-like library and still serve as an effective drug discovery tool?

    <dialog concept="lead selection" scenario="scenario-donothing.xml" description="qualities of a hit that make it promising as a lead" poke_message="All the factors of Lipinski’s rules are metrics, as are ligand efficiency and ligand lipophilicity efficiency.  How do any of these help determine a lead’s potential as a possible drug?">
    	
        <intro>
Name and describe at least one metric that is sometimes used to judge the potential merit of one lead over another.

        <intro>
Leads from a SOSA program are no more active than other types of leads.  Discuss why advocates of the SOSA approach feel that SOSA-based leads are especially promising for drug discovery?

        <intro>
Discuss why knowing the substrate of an enzyme is helpful for the design of a competitive inhibitor of the same enzyme.
