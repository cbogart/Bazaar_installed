			<phrase>An existing drug is found to be a promising lead for new target.  Which
property of the lead (molecular weight, potency, lipophilicity) is most "lead-like",
as opposed to "drug-like"?</phrase>

		<concept label="correct_response">
			<phrase>Correct.  As a lead, the potency will be weak.  The molecule will however
have a high, drug-like molecular weight and lipophilicity.</phrase>
		</concept>
		
		<concept label="incorrect_response">
			<phrase>Incorrect.  Because the lead is actually a drug, the lead will have drug-like
properties with respect to molecular weight and lipophilicity.  The lead's activity
against its new target will be weak.  Therefore its potency is lead-like.</phrase>
